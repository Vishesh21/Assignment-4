# Assignment-4
We selected some of the modifications frmo the below list of concepts covered int the class,:

    1.  Considereation fro number of layers and parameters
    2.  MaxPooling,
    3.  1x1 Convolutions,
    4.  3x3 Convolutions,
    5.  Receptive Field,
    6.  SoftMax,
    8.  Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
    9.  Batch Normalization,
    10.  Image Normalization,
    11.  Position of MaxPooling,
    12.  Concept of Transition Layers,
    13.  Position of Transition Layer,
    14.  DropOut
    16.  The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
    17.  The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,
    18.  Batch Size, and effects of batch size
    
    
    
    The above changes were done to achieve the following:
        1.  99.4% validation accuracy
        2.  Less than 20k Parameters
        3.  You can use anything from above you want.
        4.  Less than 20 Epochs
        5.  No fully connected layer
